Exporters are used to collect and expose the metrics from your host. These exposed metrics can be scraped by the promtheus.
One such popular exporter is Node exporter. Let's understand how to install and start the node exporter manually.

# Moving to the appropriate folder and downloading its binary from official website
cd /tools/
wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.7.0/node_exporter-1.7.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xvf node_exporter-1.7.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd node_exporter-1.7.0.linux-amd64/

# Allowing the ports at system level to enable access to node exporter 
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=9100/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

# Modifying the prometheus.yml file to add node exporter metrics as an target endpoint
***********************************************************************************************       	   
	   scrape_configs:
       - job_name: "node"
         static_configs:
           - targets: ["localhost:9100"]
*********************************************************************************************** 

# Starting the node exporter manually
 ./node_exporter

# Verifying the node exporter endpoint metrics in prometheus gui
targets --> http://localhost:9100/metrics
graph --> search for node which will list out all the metrics collected by node exporter. Thus you have configured node exporter.


Note: If the node exporter is not listed under metrics, then restart your prometheus using systemctl restart prometheus.service
