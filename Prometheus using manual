sudo firewall-cmd --reload

# Starting the prometheus manually (But this is suitable only for development and testing, in production environment it is recommended to run prometheus as a service because in manual method it will not restart automatically if prometheus gets crashed. Handling prometheus as a service enables the systemd to take care of it and boots it up automatically if server is restarted)
./prometheus (or) ./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml

# Accessing prometheus on gui
In browser you can access prometheus using:
publicip:9090
   
(Under targets tab we will have localhost:9090/metrics as an endpoint, this is the default metrics that are collected by prometheus itself. It doesn't require any other exporters. These metrics are about prometheus server itself) 

The next document "Prometheus as a service" will explain how you can run prometheus as a service.
